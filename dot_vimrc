" --- Minimal .vimrc Configuration ---

" Disable Vi compatibility mode. This is crucial for modern Vim behavior.
" It tells Vim not to try and emulate the very old 'vi' editor,
" which is key for backspace to work as expected.
set nocompatible

" Set the backspace key behavior in insert mode:
" 'indent': allows backspacing over auto-indentation.
" 'eol': allows backspacing over end-of-line characters (joining lines).
" 'start': allows backspacing over text typed before the current insert mode session.
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" Show line numbers (optional, but very commonly desired).
set number

" Enable filetype detection (helps with basic file-specific settings).
" This is usually very lightweight and should generally work.
filetype indent on
filetype plugin on
